## Development

You need to configure Google Maps Platform and Firebase to make game work.
See the instructions below.

-   [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-the-api-key)
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start)
-   [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start)

Once you get an API key and register the project with Firebase, copy `.env.dist` named `.env`and replace all variables.

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```

Download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have and make sure you can run `npm` from the terminal.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Run the project
npm run serve

# build for production
npm run build
```
